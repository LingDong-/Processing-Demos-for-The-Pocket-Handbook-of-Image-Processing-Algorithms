[Processing](https://processing.org/) demos made when reading the book [*The Pocket Handbook of Image Processing Algorithms in C* (Harley R. Myler & Arthur R. Weeks)](http://adaptiveart.eecs.umich.edu/2011/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-pocket-handbook-of-image-processing-algorithms-in-C.pdf).

Featuring:

- C listings in the book ported to Processing.
- Each algorithm is a standalone Processing sketch with no inter-dependency.
- Each sketch includes a usage example. 
- Bugs in the book are fixed, and explained in the header comments.
- Other notes/thoughts about the algorithms/implementations are also included in header comments.
- The original "C89" flavour is preserved.
- Each sketch folder includes a `preview.png` to show what to expect without running the sketch.

Some trivial topics (e.g. flipping an image) are currently being skipped, but may occur as part of the code for another algorithm.

A work in progress.

Thanks to @golanlevin for gifting me with the (physical) book :)
